**How to hunt:**

* Click the hunting button on the main screen to start your hunt!

* While hunting you will encounter either monsters or boon cards.

* Monsters have a weakness, health, a reward, and a fee for running away.

* Draw cards from your deck to attempt to face the challenge in front of you. If you have the resource needed for the encounter, click and drag that resource on top of the monster to attack it. If you failed to draw the correct card from your deck into your hand, you will have to start burning cards.  If you burn enough cards to fulfill the run requirement, an option for running will become available. Use this to escape from an encounter that you can't win!

* Boon cards are specific resource cards that you can take with you and add to your hand. While great to find while out in the wilderness, your deck size limit (hand + deck) can never exceed 15 cards. This means you will be forced to burn as many cards as needed to meet the deck limit. However, you can freely choose which cards to burn from your current hand.

**How to assist villagers:**

* Villagers have specific resource requests that are needed to fulfill a delivery request. You will notice that villagers don't give rewards for completion, but instead give you reputation points (the star icon in your inventory). Get 10 of these and you win! However, running from a villager will burn your reputation... which if it gets to 0, you will be banned from the village forever.

**How to win:**

Get 10 reputation points by fulfilling requests made by villagers!

**How to lose:**

Either run away from villagers requests enough to tarnish your reputation forever OR run out of cards in the wilderness.
